# Pible
Pible is a battery-free mote for Perpetual Indoor BLE applications. It can be used for a general set of indoor applications including event detection (e.g. room occupancy) or periodical sensing (e.g. temperature monitoring). It leverages indoor light to harvest energy from the environment and store it in a super-capacitor that can be recharged up to a million times. The current version exploits a 1.5F supercapacitor allowing sensing operations (i.e. temperature) for more than 10 days without any lighting availability. It is equipped with the following sensors:

- Temperature & Humidity (HDC1000)
- Motion Sensor (Passive Infrared Sensor from Panasonic)
- Light (OPT3001)
- Barometer (BMP280)
- Accelerometer & Gyroscope & Magnetometer (MPU-9250)
- Reed Switch
- Microphone (SPH0641LU4H-1)

It embeds the TI CC2650MODA and can be configured with Bluetooth Low Energy (i.e. BLE) for data transmissions and exploited for beaconing.

As of today, more than 70 nodes are currently deployed in the CSE building of UC San Diego across student research labs, classrooms, faculty offices, and corridors and its functionalities have been proved for years. Data generated by Pible is sent and stored in an external database for easy retrieval and query.


# Pible Simulator:
Inside the "simulator" folder you can run "pible_simulator.py" that simulates Pible lifetime based on energy gathered and operations executed. To check how Pible behaves under different environments, open the file and modify at the top of it the parameters such as light intensity, PIR events to detect etc. Enjoy!
