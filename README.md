# Pible
Pible is a battery-free mote for Perpetual Indoor BLE applications. It leverages indoor light to harvest energy from the environment and store it in a super-capacitor. The current version exploits a 1.5F supercapacitor that can store an amount of energy that can allow simple sensing indoor operations (i.e. temperature) for more than 10 days. It can be used for a general set of indoor applications since it embeds the following sensors:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Light
- Barometer
- Accelerometer & Gyroscope
- Reed Switch
- Motion Sensor (Passive Infrared Sensor)
- Microphone

It mounts the TI CC2650MODA that can be configured for Bluethoot Low Energy transmissions (i.e. BLE) and exploited for beaconing.
