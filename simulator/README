To simulate Pible's behavior run "pible_simulator.py". The simulator will plot the supercapacitor voltage, light intensity and PIR events detected. 
To check how Pible behaves under different environments, open the file and modify at the top of it the parameters such as light intensity, PIR events to detect etc. 
Enjoy!
